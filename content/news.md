The [competiton rules](/organisation/rules) have been amended with clarifications regarding the contest environment
and allowed software. Proctoring is not required for teams from countries or areas where disease control laws make it
impossible. For them, the provided virtual machine is **required**. This is because the virtual machine is immutable:
the root partition is read only and the contestant user does not have `sudo` rights. The VM is based on
[NixOS](https://nixos.org/).
