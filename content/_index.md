## Welcome!

The **9th Romanian Master of Informatics**, **RMI 2021**, will be held
~~in Bucharest~~ **Online**, from **December 15th** to **December 17th**, **2021** by the
**"Tudor Vianu" National High School of Computer Science**.

Because of the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, RMI 2021 will again be run as an online
competition. As such, this yearâ€™s edition largely keeps the requirements for proctoring
and contest environments from last year's edition, being similar to other contests
organised this year in this regard.

The specific details are laid out in the [Competition Rules](/organisation/rules).
