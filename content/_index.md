## Welcome!

The **28th Balkan Olympiad in Informatics**, **BOI 2022**, will be held
in Bucharest, Romania, from **October 3rd** to **October 8th**, **2022** by the
**Society of Excellence and Performance in Informatics**.

The Balkan Olympiad in Informatics is a programming contest for high school
students from countries around or close to the Balkan Peninsula. Each
participating country sends a team of 4 contestants, selected by their national
olympiads or contests.

This year, Romania will have the honour of hosting the excellent participants
during the contest week. We are happy that these most gifted students from
Balkan region of Europe will have the possibility to prove their knowledge and
skills in Informatics and Algorithmics. We, the hosts of the Olympiad, will
make our best efforts to provide the best conditions during the competition.
We want to thank our sponsors, all participating countries and our vounteers
for making this year's contest finally possible onsite.

**We will do our best to make BOI 2022 a memorable event!**
