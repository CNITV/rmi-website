## Welcome!

The **10th Romanian Master of Informatics**, **RMI 2022**, will be held
in Bucharest, Romania, from **October 3rd** to **October 8th**, **2022** by the
**Tudor Vianu National High School of Computer Science**, together with the
**Society of Excellence and Performance in Informatics**.

RMI provides a great opportunity for young people to demonstrate their
abilities in Informatics, to exchange knowledge and to enhance cross-cultural
contacts in high-school education. Coming to RMI 2022, participants will have
opportunities to make new friends, to visit a friendly country, and to discover
the culture of Romania.

This year, the Romanian Master of Informatics will be hosted in parallel with
the [Balkan Olympiad in Informatics](https://boi2022.lbi.ro). We look forward to
meeting you at RMI 2022 in Bucharest, Romania!

**We will do our best to make BOI 2022 a memorable event!**
